# dotfiles

Hello everyone, these are the dotfiles I currently use in my Archlinux installations

All these files are located in the home directory

There are 2 main lists:

- `pkglist-laptop` : list of packages installed on my desktop computer
- `pkglist-common` : list of packages installed on my laptop computer
- `pkglist-utils` : list of essential packages in a base installation
