Usage: dotfiler.sh [-h] (-[dipu])+ [system-tags]

Operational arguments:

  -i, --install  Installs packages and configures the system.
  -p, --pull     Copies dotfiles into the repository.
  -u, --update   Updates the installed packages list.
  -x, --extra    Install dotfiles' extra dependencies.

System tags:
  System tags are optional arguments that MUST NOT start with the dash "-"
  character. They're used to specify a system to work with. Example systems are
  "laptop", "desktop", "shared-pc", "sister", "Groctel", etc.
  If no system was specified, the default system "" will be used.

Filelist file:
  Dotfiler needs a filelist file to keep track of the files in your system. This
  file should be named "filelist" by default or "filelist-SYSTEM" for an
  specific system, e.g. "filelist-desktop".
  This file keeps track of your dotfiles using the following syntax:
  - Regular files: The path to the file from ~/.
  - Directories: The path to the file from ~/ terminated with "/*".
  For example, here are a regular file and a directory:
    .config/i3/config
    .local/share/fonts/*

Pkglist file:
  Dotfiler keeps tracks of your installed packages in a pkglist file that
  follows the same naming conventions as the filelist file but does not need to
  be explicitly created by the user. To keep it simple, it only tracks the
  packages explicitly installed by the user.

Deplist file:
  You can store some commands to be run by Dotfiler in a deplist file that
  follows the same naming conventions as the filelist and pkglist files.
  Commands are parsed line by line and must not contain linefeeds. For example,
  these are two valid lines containing commands:
    curl -fLo \$HOME/.antigen.zsh git.io/antigen
    vim +"so \$HOME/.vimrc" +PlugInstall +qa\!

Argument order:
  Arguments are stored in a list of operations and a list of systems. Dotfiler
  will run all operations in the order they were passed in all systems in the
  order they were passed. For example, the following call:
    $ dotfiler.sh -p -u common laptop
  Will run the following tasks:
    - pull common
    - pull laptop
    - update common
    - update laptop

CAVEATS:
  This program only keeps track of your packages with "pacman" and "yay" on Arch
  or "apt" on Ubuntu. Pull request the project to add support other managers.
